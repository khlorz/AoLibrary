# AoLibrary
***
A C++ library that is pretty much a collection of third-party libraries and my own implementations and some, and then centralized for ease of usage.

## Third-Party Dependencies

AoLibrary relies on several external libraries. These are **not included** in the repository and must be obtained separately by the user.

For more details, see:

- [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE.md)
- [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)

## About the Name

**Ao (青)** means *blue* in Japanese.

There is no deep technical meaning behind the name. I just really like the color blue.
